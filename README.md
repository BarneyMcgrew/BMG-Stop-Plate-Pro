# BMG-Stop-Plate-Pro
The wired stop plate project has passed itâ€™s first iteration which means we are ready to take the stop plates further into a wireless and more interactive version. This version uses different hardware and is designed to perform as accurately as the wired stop plate and with the ability to expand in function as the community sees fit.  The key requirements of this project is to ensure the stop plates are easy to setup and function as easily as the wired stop plates. We are also going to try and make sure that the cost of this project is kept to a minimal, whilst ensuring that the quality of the hardware is adequate and expandable. One of our main concerns with a wireless solution compared to a wired solution is maintaining accurate time keeping that is consistent to IPSC standards. This will be done using networking and should be acceptable as long as it is accurate to the millisecond.
